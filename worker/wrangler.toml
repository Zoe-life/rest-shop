# Base Service Worker (Products, Orders, User, Auth)
# This worker now acts as a lightweight proxy to the Node.js backend
# where all MongoDB/Mongoose operations are handled.
# 
# Microservices Architecture:
# - Gateway Worker (wrangler-gateway.toml) - Main entry point, routes traffic
# - Payment Service (wrangler-payments.toml) - Handles all payment operations
# - Base Service (this file) - Handles products, orders, user, auth
# - Node.js Backend - Handles all database operations with Mongoose
